Playing around with python

Not familiar with the language or git, just playing around.

This bot uses beautiful soup to troll a given subreddit, and post the headlines of that page in an irc channel.

I was surprised about how easy this was coming from my normal languages I use.  But I am sure it isn't a great implementation.
